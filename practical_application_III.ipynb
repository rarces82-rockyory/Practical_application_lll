    "The comparison shows that both Logistic Regression and SVM achieve the highest test accuracy (approximately 0.893), exceeding the baseline model. However, SVM requires significantly longer training time, while Logistic Regression achieves comparable performance with substantially lower computational cost. The Decision Tree model exhibits clear overfitting, achieving perfect training accuracy but much lower test accuracy. Overall, Logistic Regression provides the best trade-off between performance, efficiency, and interpretability"
